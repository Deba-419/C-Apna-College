This flow chart illustrates the different components of the University doctor appointment system and how they are interconnected. Users start on the Home page, which leads them to the different doctor categories. From there, they can either search and book a doctor or view the list of top 10 doctors. They can also add a patient and view doctor details.

Once a user books an appointment, the system verifies and approves it. The user can also chat with the doctor using the Live Chat feature. Users can log in, register, and view their appointments in the system. Finally, users can exit the system when they're finished.

I hope this flow chart helps you visualize the different aspects of your project! Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.


Users (userID, name, email, password)
    PK: userID
    
Patients (patID, name, email, password)
    PK: patID
    FK: userID (from Users table)
    
Doctors (docID, name, specialty, rating, email, password)
    PK: docID
    FK: userID (from Users table)
    
Appointments (appID, docID, patID, date, time, status)
    PK: appID
    FK: docID (from Doctors table)
    FK: patID (from Patients table)
    
Chats (chatID, docID, patID, message, time)
    PK: chatID
    FK: docID (from Doctors table)
    FK: patID (from Patients table)

This model includes the five main entities in your project and their attributes. Users table contains the common attributes between Patients and Doctors tables. Each appointment in the Appointments table is associated with a specific patient and a specific doctor. The Chats table stores the communication between patients and doctors.

Note that this is just a rough draft and may not include all the necessary attributes and relationships for your project. Please review it and let me know if you have any additional requirements or modifications.
